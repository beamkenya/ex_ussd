  - [LiveViewTest] Automatically synchronize before render events

## 0.13.0 (2020-05-21)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - No longer send event metadata by default. Metadata is now opt-in and user defined at the `LiveSocket` level.
  To maintain backwards compatiblity with pre-0.13 behaviour, you can provide the following metadata option:

  ```javascript
  let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
    params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken},
    metadata: {
      click: (e, el) => {
        return {
          altKey: e.altKey,
          shiftKey: e.shiftKey,
          ctrlKey: e.ctrlKey,
          metaKey: e.metaKey,
          x: e.x || e.clientX,
          y: e.y || e.clientY,
          pageX: e.pageX,
          pageY: e.pageY,
          screenX: e.screenX,
          screenY: e.screenY,
          offsetX: e.offsetX,
          offsetY: e.offsetY,
          detail: e.detail || 1,
        }
      },
      keydown: (e, el) => {
        return {
          altGraphKey: e.altGraphKey,
          altKey: e.altKey,
          code: e.code,
          ctrlKey: e.ctrlKey,
          key: e.key,
          keyIdentifier: e.keyIdentifier,
          keyLocation: e.keyLocation,
          location: e.location,
          metaKey: e.metaKey,
          repeat: e.repeat,
          shiftKey: e.shiftKey
        }
      }
    }
  })
  ```

### Bug fixes
  - Fix error caused by Chrome sending a keydown event on native UI autocomplete without a `key`
  - Fix server error when a live navigation request issues a redirect
  - Fix double window bindings when explicit calls to LiveSocket connect/disconnect/connect

### Enhancements

  - Add `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.put_connect_info/2` and `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.put_connect_params/2`
  - Add support for tracking static asset changes on the page across cold server deploys
  - Add support for passing a `@myself` target to a hook's `pushEventTo` target
  - Add configurable metadata for events with new `metadata` LiveSocket option
  - Add `"_mounts"` key in connect params which specifies the number of times a LiveView has mounted

## 0.12.1 (2020-04-19)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix component `innerHTML` being discarded when a sibling DOM element appears above it, in cases where the component lacks a DOM ID
  - Fix Firefox reconnecting briefly during hard redirects
  - Fix `phx-disable-with` and other pending attributes failing to be restored when an empty patch is returned by server
  - Ensure LiveView module is loaded before mount to prevent first application request logging errors if the very first request is to a connected LiveView

## 0.12.0 (2020-04-16)

This version of LiveView comes with an overhaul of the testing module, more closely integrating your LiveView template with your LiveView events. For example, in previous versions, you could write this test:

  ```elixir
  render_click(live_view, "increment_by", %{by: 1})
  ```

However, there is no guarantee that there is any element on the page with a `phx-click="increment"` attribute and `phx-value-by` set to 1. With LiveView 0.12.0, you can now write:

  ```elixir
  live_view
  |> element("#term .buttons a", "Increment")
  |> render_click()
  ```

The new implementation will check there is a button at `#term .buttons a`, with "Increment" as text, validate that it has a `phx-click` attribute and automatically submit to it with all relevant `phx-value` entries. This brings us closer to integration/acceptance test frameworks without any of the overhead and complexities of running a headless browser.

### Enhancements
  - Add `assert_patch/3` and `assert_patched/2` for asserting on patches
  - Add `follow_redirect/3` to automatically follow redirects from `render_*` events
  - Add `phx-trigger-action` form annotation to trigger an HTTP form submit on next DOM patch

### Bug fixes
  - Fix `phx-target` `@myself` targetting a sibling LiveView component with the same component ID
  - Fix `phx:page-loading-stop` firing before the DOM patch has been performed
  - Fix `phx-update="prepend"` failing to properly patch the DOM when the same ID is updated back to back
  - Fix redirects on mount failing to copy flash

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-error-for` has been removed in favor of `phx-feedback-for`. `phx-feedback-for` will set a `phx-no-feedback` class whenever feedback has to be hidden
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.children/1` has been renamed to `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.live_children/1`
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.find_child/2` has been renamed to `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.find_live_child/2`
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect/3` no longer matches on the flash, instead it returns the flash
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect/3` no longer matches on the patch redirects, use `assert_patch/3` instead
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_remove/3` has been removed. If the LiveView crashes, it will cause the test to crash too
  - Passing a path with DOM IDs to `render_*` test functions is deprecated. Furthermore, they now require a `phx-target="<%= @id %>"` on the given DOM ID:

    ```html
    <div id="component-id" phx-target="component-id">
      ...
    </div>
    ```

    ```elixir
    html = render_submit([view, "#component-id"], event, value)
    ```

    In any case, this API is deprecated and you should migrate to the new element based API.

## 0.11.1 (2020-04-08)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix readonly states failing to be undone after an empty diff
  - Fix dynamically added child failing to be joined by the client
  - Fix teardown bug causing stale client sessions to attempt a rejoin on reconnect
  - Fix orphaned prepend/append content across joins
  - Track `unless` in LiveEEx engine

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `render_event`/`render_click` and friends now expect a DOM ID selector to be given when working with components. For example, instead of `render_click([live, "user-13"])`, you should write `render_click([live, "#user-13"])`, mirroring the `phx-target` API.
  - Accessing the socket assigns directly `@socket.assigns[...]` in a template will now raise the exception `Phoenix.LiveView.Socket.AssignsNotInSocket`. The socket assigns are available directly inside the template as LiveEEx `assigns`, such as `@foo` and `@bar`. Any assign access should be done using the assigns in the template where proper change tracking takes place.

### Enhancements
  - Trigger debounced events immediately on input blur
  - Support `defaults` option on `LiveSocket` constructor to configure default `phx-debounce` and `phx-throttle` values, allowing `<input ... phx-debounce>`
  - Add `detail` key to click event metadata for detecting double/triple clicks

## 0.11.0 (2020-04-06)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Remove `socket.assigns` during render to avoid change tracking bugs. If you were previously relying on passing `@socket` to functions then referencing socket assigns, pass the explicit assign instead to your functions from the template.
  - Removed `assets/css/live_view.css`. If you want to show a progress bar then in `app.css`, replace


    ```diff
    - @import "../../../../deps/phoenix_live_view/assets/css/live_view.css";
    + @import "../node_modules/nprogress/nprogress.css";
    ```

    and add `nprogress` to `assets/package.json`. Full details in the [Progress animation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.11.0/installation.html#progress-animation)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix client issue with greater than two levels of LiveView nesting
  - Fix bug causing entire LiveView to be re-rendering with only a component changed
  - Fix issue where rejoins would not trigger `phx:page-loading-stop`

### Enhancements
  - Support deep change tracking so `@foo.bar` only executes and diffs when bar changes
  - Add `@myself` assign, to allow components to target themselves instead of relying on a DOM ID, for example: `phx-target="<%= @myself %>"`
  - Optimize various client rendering scenarios for faster DOM patching
  of components and append/prepended content
  - Add `enableProfiling()` and `disableProfiling()` to `LiveSocket` for client performance profiling to aid the development process
  - Allow LiveViews to be rendered inside LiveComponents
  - Add support for clearing flash inside components

## 0.10.0 (2020-03-18)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Rename socket assign `@live_view_module` to `@live_module`
  - Rename socket assign `@live_view_action` to `@live_action`
  - LiveView no longer uses the default app layout and `put_live_layout` is no longer supported. Instead, use `put_root_layout`. Note, however, that the layout given to `put_root_layout` must use `@inner_content` instead of `<%= render(@view_module, @view_template, assigns) %>` and that the root layout will also be used by regular views. Check the [Live Layouts](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.10.0/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-live-layouts) section of the docs.

### Bug fixes
  - Fix loading states causing nested LiveViews to be removed during live navigation
  - Only trigger `phx-update="ignore"` hook if data attributes have changed
  - Fix LiveEEx fingerprint bug causing no diff to be sent in certain cases

### Enhancements
  - Support collocated templates where an `.html.leex` template of the same basename of the LiveView will be automatically used for `render/1`
  - Add `live_title_tag/2` helper for automatic prefix/suffix on `@page_title` updates

## 0.9.0 (2020-03-08)

### Bug fixes
  - Do not set ignored inputs and buttons as readonly
  - Only decode paths in URIs
  - Only destroy main descendents when replacing main
  - Fix sibling component patches when siblings at same root DOM tree
  - Do not pick the layout from `:use` on child LiveViews
  - Respect when the layout is set to `false` in the router and on mount
  - Fix sibling component patch when component siblings lack a container
  - Make flash optional (i.e. LiveView will still work if you don't `fetch_flash` before)

### Enhancements
  - Raise if `:flash` is given as an assign
  - Support user-defined metadata in router
  - Allow the router to be accessed as `socket.router`
  - Allow `MFArgs` as the `:session` option in the `live` router macro
  - Trigger page loading event when main LV errors
  - Automatially clear the flash on live navigation examples - only the newly assigned flash is persisted

## 0.8.0 (2020-02-22)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Remove `Phoenix.LiveView.Flash` in favor of `:fetch_live_flash` imported by `Phoenix.LiveView.Router`
  - Live layout must now access the child contents with `@inner_content` instead of invoking the LiveView directly
  - Returning `:stop` tuples from LiveView `mount` or `handle_[params|call|cast|info|event]` is no longer supported. LiveViews are stopped when issuing a `redirect` or `push_redirect`

### Enhancements
  - Add `put_live_layout` plug to put the root layout used for live routes
  - Allow `redirect` and `push_redirect` from mount
  - Use acknowledgement tracking to avoid patching inputs until the server has processed the form event
  - Add css loading states to all phx bound elements with event specfic css classes
  - Dispatch `phx:page-loading-start` and `phx:page-loading-stop` on window for live navigation, initial page loads, and form submits, for user controlled page loading integration
  - Allow any phx bound element to specify `phx-page-loading` to dispatch loading events above when the event is pushed
  - Add client side latency simulator with new `enableLatencySim(milliseconds)` and `disableLatencySim()`
  - Add `enableDebug()` and `disableDebug()` to `LiveSocket` for ondemand browser debugging from the web console
  - Do not connect LiveSocket WebSocket or bind client events unless a LiveView is found on the page

  - Fix select bug in Firefox causing the highlighted index to jump when a patch is applied during hover state

## 0.7.0 (2020-02-12)

  - `live_redirect` was removed in favor of `push_patch` (for updating the URL and params of the current LiveView) and `push_redirect` (for updating the URL to another LiveView)
  - `live_link` was removed in favor of  `live_patch` (for updating the URL and params of the current LiveView) and `live_redirect` (for updating the URL to another LiveView)
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect` no longer accepts an anonymous function in favor of executing the code
  prior to asserting the redirects, just like `assert_receive`.

### Enhancements
  - Support `@live_view_action` in LiveViews to simplify tracking of URL state

### Enhancements
  - Allow window beforeunload to be cancelled without losing websocket connection

### Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix phx-change bug causing phx-target to not be used

## 0.5.0 (2020-01-15)

LiveView now makes the connection session automatically available in LiveViews. However, to do so, you need to configure your endpoint accordingly, **otherwise LiveView will fail to connect**.

The steps are:

  1) Find `plug Plug.Session, ...` in your endpoint.ex and move the options `...` to a module attribute:

      ```elixir
      @session_options [
        ...
      ]
      ```

  2) Change the `plug Plug.Session` to use said attribute:

      ```elixir
      plug Plug.Session, @session_options
      ```

  3) Also pass the `@session_options` to your LiveView socket:

      ```elixir
      socket "/live", Phoenix.LiveView.Socket,
        websocket: [connect_info: [session: @session_options]]
      ```

  4) You should define the CSRF meta tag inside <head> in your layout, before `app.js` is included:

      ```html
      <%= csrf_meta_tag() %>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/js/app.js") %>"></script>
      ```

  5) Then in your app.js:

      ```javascript
      let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content");
      let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}});
      ```

Also note that **the session from now on will have string keys**. LiveView will warn if atom keys are used.

### Enhancements
  - Respect new tab behavior in `live_link`
  - Add `beforeUpdate` and `beforeDestroy` JS hooks
  - Make all assigns defined on the socket mount available on the layout on first render
  - Provide support for live layouts with new `:layout` option
  - Detect duplicate IDs on the front-end when DEBUG mode is enabled
  - Automatically forward the session to LiveView
  - Support "live_socket_id" session key for identifying (and disconnecting) LiveView sockets
  - Add support for `hibernate_after` on LiveView processes
  - Support redirecting to full URLs on `live_redirect` and `redirect`
  - Add `offsetX` and `offsetY` to click event metadata
  - Allow `live_link` and `live_redirect` to exist anywhere in the page and it will always target the main LiveView (the one defined at the router)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-target="window"` has been removed in favor of `phx-window-keydown`, `phx-window-focus`, etc, and the `phx-target` binding has been repurposed for targetting LiveView and LiveComponent events from the client
  - `Phoenix.LiveView` no longer defined `live_render` and `live_link`. These functions have been moved to `Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers` which can now be fully imported in your views. In other words, replace `import Phoenix.LiveView, only: [live_render: ..., live_link: ...]` by `import Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers`

## 0.4.1 (2019-11-07)

  - [LiveViewTest] Fix `phx-update` append/prepend containers not building proper DOM content
  - [LiveViewTest] Fix `phx-update` append/prepend containers not updating existing child containers with matching IDs

## 0.2.0 (2019-09-12)

### Enhancements
  - [LiveView] Add new `:container` option to `use Phoenix.LiveView`
  - [LiveViewTest] Add `live_isolated` test helper for testing LiveViews which are not routable

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Replace `configure_temporary_assigns/2` with 3-tuple mount return, supporting a `:temporary_assigns` key
  - Do not allow `redirect`/`live_redirect` on mount nor in child live views
  - All `phx-update` containers now require a unique ID
  - `LiveSocket` JavaScript constructor now requires explicit dependency injection of Phoenix Socket constructor. For example:

```javascript
import {Socket} from "phoenix"
import LiveSocket from "phoenix_live_view"

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {...})
```

## 0.1.2

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-value` has no effect, use `phx-value-*` instead
  - The `:path_params` key in session has no effect (use `handle_params` in `LiveView` instead)

## 0.1.1 (2019-08-27)

### Enhancements
  - Use optimized `insertAdjacentHTML` for faster append/prepend and proper css animation handling
  - Allow for replacing previously appended/prepended elements by replacing duplicate IDs during append/prepend instead of adding new DOM nodes

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix duplicate append/prepend updates when parent content is updated
  - Fix JS hooks not being applied for appending and prepended content

## 0.1.0 (2019-08-25)

### Enhancements
  - The LiveView `handle_in/3` callback now receives a map of metadata about the client event
  - For `phx-change` events, `handle_in/3` now receives a `"_target"` param representing the keyspace of the form input name which triggered the change
  - Multiple values may be provided for any phx binding by using the `phx-value-` prefix, such as `phx-value-myval1`, `phx-value-myval2`, etc
  - Add control over the DOM patching via `phx-update`, which can be set to `"replace"`, `"append"`, `"prepend"` or `"ignore"`

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-ignore` was renamed to `phx-update="ignore"`
